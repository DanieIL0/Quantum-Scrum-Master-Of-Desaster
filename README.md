# Quantum‑Scrum‑Master‑Of‑Desaster

> *“If a user story isn’t observed, is it still in the sprint, is it not, or do we just choose to ignore it?”*

This satirical repo entangles quantum mechanics with Scrum anti‑patterns:

* **Entangled Sprints** – every task exists in superposition (Done / Not‑Done / “Blocked by Jira (Yay, who doesn't love Jira)”).  
* **Probabilistic Stand‑Ups** – status collapses to random jargon once measured (5 minutes? You wish).  
* **Developer Wave‑Functions** – devs thread‑hop, generate technical debt, then vanish.  
* **Infinite Backlog Expansion** – memory leaks model the ever‑growing ticket pile.

First install quiskit and quiskit-aer!  
Run with:

```bash
